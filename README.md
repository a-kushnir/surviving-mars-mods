## Tourist Specialization

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-kushnir/surviving-mars-mods/main/Tourist%20Specialization/Preview.png" alt="Tourist Specialization" title="Tourist Specialization" align="right" height="180" />

Sets either Tourist specialization or No specialization for colonists who have Tourist trait. That makes filters work better.

Custom icons for tourists will apply, so it's easier to spot them.

Both options, Specialization and Custom Icons, are configurable.
